Welcome to the DankGrinder Repository! As we all know that grinding dank is pretty boring.
Thats why we made this dankgrinder script for you!

<--Here is how you can use the script-->
1. You MUST have Python installed! If you don't have then download from https://www.python.org
2. Go to a terminal and say "pip install pyautogui"(Pyautogui is a library in python which is used to control keyboard).
3. Launch the script! Make sure to use the latest file as it provides latest features.

Thanks for visiting us! I also made a OwOGrinder. You can also check that out.
